# Advent of Code Solutions

## What is Advent of Code?

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is a yearly programming challenge that runs for the first 25
days of December.

This repository will hold my solutions.

## Solutions

### [2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023)

Solutions implemented in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) :crab: , with an attempt to write more rust-like rust
instead of just using rust.

### [2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)

Solutions in Rust. Will be adding these later, after consolidating from another
[repository](https://github.com/nullpuppy/advent-of-code-2022).
